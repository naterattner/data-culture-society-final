    <h1>The LA Rebellion as a Third University</h1>
    <h2>A network analysis and visualization of Black filmmakers at UCLA from the 1960s–1980s</h2>

    <div>
        <p>In "A Third University Is Possible," la paperson examines the colonial histories and issues at play across America's elite universities. Even within these rigid systems, the author argues, there is room for subversion and for alternative communities to flourish.</p>

        <p>One third university example that la paperson describes is the "LA Rebellion" movement of Black filmmakers at UCLA between the 1960s and 1980s, made up of Black radical filmmakers including Julie Dash, Charles Burnett, Larry Clarke, Haile Gerima and others.</p>

        <p>This movement is based within a large research institution that might fall into the "first university" category. But paperson describes, while discussing a documentary about the movement, how the LA Rebellion created a "third worlding film factory":</p>

        <p class="pull-quote">What struck me through the stories in Davis's documentary were the coincidental linkages between filmmakers, the collaborations necessary for making a film, the materiality of communication technologies, the copyright somersaults in using images and sound, the funding not just to make films but to have them shown, the legal and capital juggernaut of a Hollywood machine that Black filmmakers have to subvert.</p>

        <p>These "linkages," or the network among the group of filmmakers, is an example of an information undercommons. It's not necessarily the institution itself, but the connections between the individuals, that allowed for the movement to take place.</p>

        <p>UCLA hosts an <a href="https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/la-rebellion/filmography" target="_blank">online list</a> of LA Rebellion films and filmmakers, with individuals' roles on various projects – including directors, producers, editors, writers, cinematographers, cast and crew. A visualization of the links among these films shows that there is a network within the LA Rebellion movement.</p>

        <p>In the visualization below, each node is a film. Links to other films indicate a shared individual involved in both films. If more than one individual is involved in both films, the link line is thicker. One exception is if two films have only a shared director, a link is not visualized as the goal is to find links between projects, not illustrate webs of prolific directors. </p>

    <div>
        <p>Not every film is linked and many stand alone. The dataset is likely an incomplete list some projects appear small-scale, with only a name or two across all roles listed. And a limitation of this visualization is that it only shows formal links, when an individual held a role on multiple films, and was recorded as doing so. Tracking the less-formal links that might be part of an information undercommons – words of advice or encouragement, small-scale contributions to a film, introductions to funding sources or other filmmakers – are impossible to see in this dataset.</p>
